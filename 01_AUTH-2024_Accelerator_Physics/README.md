Material heavily based on [Hands-On Lattice and Longitudinal Calculations - Python version](https://github.com/cerncas/hands-on-lattice-exercises) course of the [2023 CERN Accelerator School (CAS)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1226773/) held in Santa Susanna, Spain.

Course is split in 5 parts:

- Part I: Tracking basics
    - Representing particles
        - Exercise 1: representing a single particle in Python
        - Exercise 2: representing multiple particles (a beam) in Python
    - Accelerator elements
        - Exercise 3: transfering particles in a drift space
        - Exercise 4: focusing particles 
    - Simple beamlines
        - Exercise 5: transfer a particle in a beamline

- Part II: Single particle dynamics in simple beamlines
    - The FODO cell
        - Exercise 6: tracking in a FODO cell
        - Exercise 7: x' of the FODO cell (quadrupole kicks)
        - Exercise 8: multiple FODO cells
        - Exercise 9: betatron oscillations
        - Exercise 10: stability of the FODO cell

- Part III: Single particle dynamics in periodic systems (ring)
    - Transverse dynamics in a ring
        - Exercise 11: phase space of a ring
        - Exercise 12: optics, trace and single particle emittance of the previous case
        - Exercise 13: stability of the one-turn-map
        - Exercise 14: transport of Twiss functions
