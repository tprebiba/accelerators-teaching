A series of exercises for the accelerator design and tracking using [Xsuite](https://xsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

PSB is used as an example case:

- Exercise 1 (guided): load and plot the layout of the PSB
- Exercise 2 (guided): plot the optics functions
- Exercise 3 (guided): matching
- Exercise 4 (guided): tracking
- Exercise 5 (guided): reconstruct tune from turn-by-turn data
- Exercise 6 (guided): motion near a quadrupolar resonance - beta-beating
- Exercise 7 (guided): motion on a quadrupolar resonance - phase space
- Exercise 8 (guided): transverse painting
- Chromaticity matching in PSB
