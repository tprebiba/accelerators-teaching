Material heavily based on [Hands-On Lattice and Longitudinal Calculations - Python version](https://github.com/cerncas/hands-on-lattice-exercises) course of the [2023 CERN Accelerator School (CAS)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1226773/) held in Santa Susanna, Spain.

Course is split in 5 parts:

- Part I: Tracking basics
    - Representing particles
        - Exercise 1 (guided): representing a single particle in Python
        - Exercise 2 (guided): representing multiple particles (a beam) in Python
    - Accelerator elements
        - Exercise 3 (guided): transfering particles in a drift space
        - Exercise 4 (guided): focusing particles 
    - Simple beamlines
        - Exercise 5 (guided): transfer a particle in a beamline

- Part II: Single particle dynamics in simple beamlines
    - The FODO cell
        - Exercise 6: tracking in a FODO cell
        - Exercise 7: x' of the FODO cell
        - Exercise 8: multiple FODO cells
        - Exercise 9: betatron oscillations
        - Exercise 10: stability of the FODO cell

- Part III: Single particle dynamics in periodic systems (ring)
    - Transverse dynamics in a ring
        - Exercise 11: phase space in a stable ring
        - Exercise 12: optics, trace and single particle emittance of the ring
        - Exercise 13: stability of the ring
        - Exercise 14: transport of Twiss functions

- Part IV: Tracking multiple particles
    - Transverse dynamics of a beam
        - Exercise 15: evolution of beam along a ring
        - Exercise 16: beam with an offset 
    - Beam emittance
        - Exercise 17: preservation of the beam emittance
        - Exercise 18: emittance and phase space area

- Part V: Tracking with Xsuite
    - The CERN Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB)
        - Exercise 19 (guided): load and plot the layout of the PSB
        - Exercise 20 (guided): plot the optics functions
        - Exercise 21 (guided): matching
        - Exercise 22 (guided): tracking
